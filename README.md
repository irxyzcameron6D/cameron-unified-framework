## What this repository is

This is the central maintained version of the Cameron Unified Framework
— a proposal that all four fundamental forces are projections of a
single complex force law. It was developed through a two-AI verification
process documented in the archive below.

For every claim in this repository there is either a number that could
have come out wrong, or an explicit statement that the claim is not
yet verified. The failures are documented alongside the successes.
That is what makes the successes trustworthy.

## The central claim

The complex charge **Q = q + im√G** has:

- Real part **q** → electric charge → electromagnetism
- Imaginary part **m√G** → gravitational charge → gravity
- Cross term **2iqm√G** → nuclear van der Waals → strong force

For neutral hydrogen: Q = im(m_p + m_e)√G  
Expanding: F = −G(m_p + m_e)²/r²  
**Newton's law, exact, from i² = −1, no free parameters.**

## Key new results (not in the published papers)

### 1. Mercury perihelion advance — first principles derivation

Previously a postulate borrowed from GR. Now derived from three
Cameron framework contributions in a strict **3:2:1 ratio**:

| Contribution | Formula | arcsec/century | Fraction |
|---|---|---|---|
| PMV kinematics (Binet) | 3πGM/(c²p) | 21.50 | 3/6 |
| M_eff = M(1+v²/c²) coupling | 2πGM/(c²p) | 14.33 | 2/6 |
| Gravitomagnetic | πGM/(c²p) | 7.17 | 1/6 |
| **Total** | **6πGM/(c²p)** | **43.00** | **6/6** |

The same M_eff = M(1+v²/c²) coupling that produces the 2/6 perihelion
contribution also produces the Eddington 2× lensing factor at v = c.
See `papers/section_VII_perihelion_advance.md`.

### 2. Relativistic beam deflection — testable prediction

For a neutral atom or neutron beam at speed β grazing the Sun:

| β | GR (arcsec) | Cameron (arcsec) | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.50 | 4.38 | 3.79 | 0.87 |
| 0.786 | 2.29 | 1.42 | 0.62 |
| 0.90 | 1.96 | 0.85 | 0.44 |
| **0.99** | **1.77** | **0.25** | **0.14** |
| massive → c | 1.752 | **0.000** | 0 |
| photon | 1.752 | 1.752 | 1.00 ✓ |

GR predicts smooth approach to Eddington. Cameron predicts a hard
discontinuity at v = c. Factor of seven difference at β = 0.99.
An experiment at β = 0.9 with 20% precision is decisive.
See `papers/section_VIII_beam_deflection.md`.

### 3. Spin-1/2 and Pauli exclusion from 6D geometry

The 720° rotation requirement follows from the PMV bivector: P_re
rotates 2π in real space → bivector phase rotates π → e^(iπ) = −1.
Full 4π rotation needed for e^(i2π) = +1.

The Pauli exclusion principle follows from counting: the P_im axis
has exactly two orientations (+n̂ and −n̂). No third identical fermion
state is geometrically possible. See `papers/section_II5_spin_pauli.md`.

### 4. Proton spin puzzle resolved (EMC 1987)

Standard QCD postulates gluon spin for the "missing" 70%.
The Cameron framework derives it kinematically:

- 30% intrinsic: P_re × P_im = (ℏ/2)n̂ — PMV bivector spin
- 70% orbital: L = r × p at 0.99c — Zitterbewegung orbital angular momentum

No new fields required.

### 5. Hull temperature speedometer

A ship at speed β through the ISM/CMB medium:

**β = (R − 1) / (R + 1)** where R = T_forward hull / T_aft hull

Local measurement of absolute velocity. No CMB dipole observation
needed. At β = 0.99: R = 199. See `papers/section_IX_contemplate.md`.

## What is open

Full documentation in `disputes/what_doesnt_work.md`.

| Gap | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Full orbital average force: factor 50,000 from Newton |

| 3 | Relativistic γ missing from Monte Carlo (~49× expected) |
| 4 | G from first principles: factor ~9 remaining |
| 5 | Outer disc rotation curve: 25–35 km/s short at 30–50 kly |

## Cosmological terminology

All early universe emission events are classified by sector and entropy character:

| Event | Correct term |
|---|---|
| Bounce annihilation | Topological phase transition emission |
| CMB — recombination | Thermal decoupling radiation |
| Nuclear binding γ | Nuclear condensation radiation |
| Neutrino decoupling | Imaginary sector information snapshot |
| Neutron decay antineutrino | Sector crossing emission |

The CMB is maximum entropy, thermally incoherent radiation. It is not coherent emission of any kind.
